                              which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such
                              installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                              to turn up in a new cluster. \n A path is optional,
                              and if present may be any string permissible in a URL.
                              You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to
                              the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. \n Attempting

                              `host` should not refer to a service running in the
                              cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might
                              be resolved via external DNS in some api servers (e.g.,
                              `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that
                              would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an
                              IP address. \n Please note that using `localhost` or
                              `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great
                              care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver
                              which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such
                              installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                              to turn up in a new cluster. \n A path is optional,
                              and if present may be any string permissible in a URL.
                              You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to
                              the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier. \n Attempting
                              to use a user or basic auth e.g. \"user:password@\"
