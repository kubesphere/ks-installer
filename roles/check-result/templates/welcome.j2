NOTESï¼š
  1. After you log into the console, please check the
     monitoring status of service components in
     "Cluster Management". If any service is not
     ready, please wait patiently until all components 
     are up and running.
  2. Please change the default password after login.
{% if istio_old_version_check is defined and istio_old_version_check.stdout.find('deployed') != -1 %}
  3. Istio has already been upgraded to istio 1.6.10
     by canary. The pods, which injected with sidecar,
      will still use 1.4.8. You can rollout restart
     your deployments to uprade the sidecar to 1.6.10
     in a appropriate time, when the traffic is not
     busy. Such as:

     ```bash
     kubectl rollout restart deploy deploy01 -n demo
     ```

     After there are no pods use 1.4.8, then you
      can uninstall the old version manually as follows:

     ```bash
      helm -n istio-system delete istio-init
      helm -n istio-system delete istio
     ```
{% endif %}
{% if devops.enabled is defined and devops.enabled %}
  4. DevOps component has been separated from ks-installer,
     please use helm chart to install devops component instead
